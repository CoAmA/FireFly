# A FireFly in the Background

Hy there, we are (Firm Name Here), and we want to give back to the community some of the javascript classes we create to please out costumers.

We admit that we can't be the best there is, so if everyone wishes to help us develop this little plugin we are happy to accept your help and give you the acknowledgements you deserve.

The next feature that will be implemented is the FireFly decizion to not go back the way it came to the node

A online demo website will be released shortly!

Thank you all in advanced and
# God Speed
